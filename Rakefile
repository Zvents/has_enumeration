    Extends ActiveRecord with the has_enumeration method that allows an
    attribute to be declared as storing an enumeration.  The enumeration
    is specified as a mapping between symbols and their underlying
    representation in the database.  Predicates are provided for each
    symbol in the enumeration and the symbols may be used in finder methods.
